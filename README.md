# Gallery 

- A gallery app based on React docs. We see two buttons: 'Hide/Show Details' and 'Next'.
The 'Hide/Show Details' on toggling hides or shows the button. It's value by default is 'show' and on clicking on it, the value changes to 'hide' and displays a paragraph displaying a description. If clicked again, it changes back to 'show' and hides the description paragraph.

- The 'Next' button displays the contents of the next artifact and on reaching the last artifact, the values changes to first, cycling through the values.
